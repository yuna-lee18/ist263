                <h2>HISTORY OF THE TAMAGOTCHI</h2>
                    <p>Tamagotchi, the iconic handheld digital pet, was released in Japan on November 23, 1996, by Bandai, co-created by Akihiro Yokoi and Aki Maita (Tamagotchi Official, n.d.). The concept was inspired by a commercial featuring a boy who couldn’t take his pet turtle on a trip, sparking the idea for a portable pet (Rossen, 2021). The name "Tamagotchi" (たまごっち) combines the Japanese word for "egg" (tamago) and the English word "watch" (Tamagotchi Fandom, n.d.).The egg-shaped device, equipped with a small LCD screen and three buttons, allowed users to raise a virtual pet by feeding, playing with, and cleaning up after it (Mel, 2023). </p>

                    <p>The pet's growth depended on the owner's care, teaching responsibility. Neglect would result in the pet’s death, often turning it into a ghost or sending it back to its home planet (Rossen, 2021). The device quickly became a sensation, with over 91 million units sold worldwide by 2023 (Tamagotchi Official, n.d.).Tamagotchi returned in 2004 with the Tamagotchi Connection, featuring infrared communication, and has since evolved with various models, including the Wi-Fi-enabled "Tamagotchi Uni" in 2023 (Tamagotchi Official, n.d.). The franchise has inspired countless imitators and remains a beloved part of pop culture (Tamagotchi Fandom, n.d.).</p>
