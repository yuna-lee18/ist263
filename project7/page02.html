                            <p>According to the Tamagotchi Wiki, Tamagotchi are a group of aliens from the distant Tamagotchi Planet, located far away from Earth. Their peaceful world was disrupted when a character named Oyajitchi made the planet drunk by giving it sake. As a result, the planet became uninhabitable, forcing the Tamagotchi to leave their home and travel in UFOs, hoping to find a new place to stay while their home recovered (Tamagotchi Wiki, n.d.).</p>

                        <div class="slide">
                            <p>One evening, Professor Banzo, a scientist, was feeling down by the Sumida River after a personal loss. Out of nowhere, a UFO crashed into him, sending him into the water. He took the damaged UFO back to his lab, where he and his assistant Mikachu helped the Tamagotchi inside. To help them adapt to Earth, Banzo created the "Tamagotchi House," an egg-shaped device with a simple screen and controls that allowed people to take care of the aliens (Tamagotchi Wiki, n.d.).</p>

                            <p>Mikachu started painting the devices in colorful designs and brought them to school, where they quickly caught the attention of her classmates. As more Tamagotchi species were discovered, Banzo sent the devices to research labs across Japan, and they eventually made their way to different parts of the world (Tamagotchi Wiki, n.d.).</p>

                            <p>The full story can be found in official books like Tamagotchi Research Report: Tamagotchi Book and Tamagotchi Honto no Hanashi. The American edition, Tamagotchi: The Official Care Guide and Record Book, mentions the Tamagotchi's arrival on Earth but leaves out the part about their planet becoming drunk, simply stating that the aliens came to learn about life on Earth (Tamagotchi Wiki, n.d.).</p>

                <h2>GEN 1, GEN 2, GEN 3: KEY DIFFERENCES IN TAMAGOTCHI RERELEASES</h2>
                    <p>The original Tamagotchi series has evolved through several rereleases, each introducing unique features while retaining the classic nurturing gameplay. Here's an overview of the key differences between the first three generations of Tamagotchi rereleases:</p>

                                <li>Gen 1: The first-generation rerelease introduced players to the original Tamagotchi experience. You start with an egg, which hatches into one of several basic characters. The gameplay revolves around feeding, cleaning up after your pet, and playing mini-games. The goal is to raise your Tamagotchi to adulthood, with different outcomes based on how you interact with it (Tamagotchi, n.d., What is Original Tamagotchi?).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                            
                            
                        <div class="slide">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Gen 2: This rerelease introduced a new set of characters, known as the "New Species Discovered!! Tamagotchi." While the core gameplay remained the same, Gen 2 brought new food options, different mini-games, and unique interactions. The evolution of your Tamagotchi depended on different care patterns, offering a fresh experience for players who had already enjoyed Gen 1. It also allowed players to unlock new characters as their Tamagotchi grew (Tamagotchi, n.d., What is Original Tamagotchi?).</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>Gen 3: Known for the Tamagotchi Angel series, this rerelease brought angelic-themed characters. New features included a "tapping" mechanic to ward off a bat called BATTCHI and expanded mini-games, such as the Shooting Star game. The care process still included feeding, cleaning, and healing your Tamagotchi, but new interactions, like offering praise when your pet prayed, added depth to the experience. Gen 3 also introduced a fashionable design, allowing players to carry the device as an accessory (Tamagotchi, n.d., Tamagotchi Angel returns with a new look!).</li>
